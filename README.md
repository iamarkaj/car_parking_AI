## Videos 
- simple streaming- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlMw43sX5mI">youtube</a>
- asynchronous multi-agent moving randomly- <a href="https://youtu.be/pVMb0hQ7V7g">youtube</a>


## Points
- This is a 3D car parking game made in <b>Unity 2018.4.24f1</b> 
- Wanted to create my own environment and try out different RL algorithms
- The simmulation is connected to a <b>python controller over TCP</b>


## Learning
- Basics of C#(obviously)
- Bit of socket programming, threading, multiprocessing in python
- Bit of how to improve performance in Unity


## RL courses
- RL course by David Silver(Internet's favorite)- <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ">youtube</a>
- yandexdataschool-Practical_RL- <a href="https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL">github</a>
- Another awesome repo- <a href="https://github.com/higgsfield/RL-Adventure">github</a>
